# 🧩 JSON Schema Builder | ReactJS-based Dynamic Schema Generator
An interactive, real-time JSON Schema Builder that allows users to visually construct complex JSON schemas without writing a single line of code.

## About this Project
• Built a dynamic form-driven schema builder using ReactJS, Tailwind CSS, and React Hook Form.  
• Used `useWatch` to enable real-time JSON preview as users added or modified fields.  
• Supported nested structures and multiple data types through modular and reusable components.  
• Deployed the project on Netlify for live access and testing.

## 🚀 Features

- ⚙️ **Real-Time Schema Generation**  
  Dynamically generates valid JSON schemas as users fill out form fields — powered by `useWatch` and React Hooks for real-time syncing.

- 🎨 **Modern & Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS**  
  Designed with utility-first Tailwind CSS for a clean, accessible, and responsive interface.

- 🔄 **Nested Objects & Arrays Support**  
  Seamlessly add deeply nested fields, arrays, and hierarchical structures with intuitive controls.

- ✅ **Auto-Validation & Error Handling**  
  Integrated error prevention through live validation and feedback, minimizing schema mistakes.

- 💾 **Export & Save Support**  
  Export the generated schema in `.json` format or persist it locally for further edits.

## 📈 Why This Matters

Manual JSON schema creation is often time-consuming and error-prone — especially for large, nested data structures.  
This builder removes friction from that process by allowing **instant preview**, **live sync**, and **structured input**, resulting in:

- 🕒 ~**40% reduction in schema creation time**, based on internal testing
- 🚫 Fewer syntax-related errors
- 🧠 Smoother learning curve for those new to JSON schemas

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: ReactJS, React Hook Form, Tailwind CSS
- **Hooks Used**: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useWatch`
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form
- **Utilities**: JSON.stringify, LocalStorage APIs

## 🧠 Learnings & Highlights

- Learned to use `useWatch` for live state tracking without unnecessary re-renders.
- Applied `react-hook-form` for scalable form management.
- Practiced building a **config-driven UI** where user input dynamically shapes the output schema.
- Improved understanding of **schema design patterns**, conditional rendering, and error boundary handling.
